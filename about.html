      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Throughout my time at career foundry, I have learned so much more about design. 
        Ive always enjoyed art, and different design pieces so I appreciated being able to 
        express that in this course. I have worked as a nanny and caregiver before pursuing design 
        this has allowed me to be able to handle multiple jobs at once and a be efficient. It has
        allowed me to pay attention to detail and the wants and needs of others. I have designed 
        multiple mobile flows as well as a responsive web app. I am interested in pursuing UI design 
        and helping websites “come to life” I am proficient in figma. I am able to take an idea from 
        paper sketches all the way to polished mockups.
